# Force Vercel Deployment

## 🚀 **To Deploy Your Latest Changes to Vercel**

The 405 error is still happening because Vercel hasn't deployed your latest changes yet. Here's how to force a deployment:

### **Option 1: Trigger Deployment via Git Push**
```bash
# Make a small change to trigger deployment
echo "# Force deployment $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Force Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### **Option 2: Manual Vercel Deployment**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "showuporelse" project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

### **Option 3: Check Vercel Build Logs**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your latest deployment
3. Check "Build Logs" for any errors
4. If there are errors, fix them and redeploy

## 🔍 **What to Check**

### **Environment Variables in Vercel:**
Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

### **Build Status:**
- Check if the build is successful
- Look for any compilation errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed

## 📋 **After Deployment**

Once deployed, test:
1. Visit https://showuporelse.com
2. Try creating an event
3. Check if 405 error is resolved

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After successful deployment:
- ✅ No more 405 errors
- ✅ Event creation works
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ localStorage best practices implemented

---

**The 405 error will be resolved once Vercel deploys your latest changes!** 🚀
