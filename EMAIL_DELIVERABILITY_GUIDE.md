# Email Deliverability & Spam Prevention Guide

## 🎯 **Quick Fixes Applied**

### ✅ **Logo Display Fix**
- **Problem**: SVG logos don't display in Gmail due to security restrictions
- **Solution**: Replaced SVG with text-based logo that works across all email clients
- **Result**: Logo now displays consistently in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.

### ✅ **Spam Prevention Headers**
- Added proper email headers to reduce spam classification:
  - `List-Unsubscribe` - Allows users to easily unsubscribe
  - `X-Auto-Response-Suppress` - Prevents auto-replies
  - `Precedence: bulk` - Indicates transactional email
  - `X-Report-Abuse` - Provides abuse reporting contact
  - `X-Campaign` - Identifies email type for filtering

## 🚀 **Additional Steps to Improve Deliverability**

### 1. **Domain Authentication (Critical)**

#### Set up SPF Record
Add this TXT record to your domain's DNS:
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
```

#### Set up DKIM (via Resend Dashboard)
1. Go to your Resend dashboard
2. Navigate to Domains
3. Add your domain (showuporelse.com)
4. Follow the DKIM setup instructions
5. Add the provided CNAME records to your DNS

#### Set up DMARC Record
Add this TXT record to your domain's DNS:
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@showuporelse.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc@showuporelse.com; sp=quarantine; adkim=r; aspf=r;
```

### 2. **Email Infrastructure Setup**

#### Create Support Email Addresses
Set up these email addresses:
- `support@showuporelse.com` - For user support
- `abuse@showuporelse.com` - For abuse reports
- `dmarc@showuporelse.com` - For DMARC reports
- `unsubscribe@showuporelse.com` - For unsubscribe requests

#### Configure Email Forwarding
Set up forwarding for the above addresses to your main support email.

### 3. **Resend Configuration**

#### Update Sending Domain
1. In Resend dashboard, add `showuporelse.com` as a verified domain
2. Update your email templates to use `noreply@showuporelse.com` instead of the default Resend domain
3. Verify the domain following Resend's instructions

#### Warm Up Your Domain
- Start with low volume (10-20 emails per day)
- Gradually increase over 2-4 weeks
- Monitor deliverability metrics in Resend dashboard

### 4. **Content Optimization**

#### Subject Line Best Practices
- Keep under 50 characters
- Avoid spam trigger words: "Free", "Act Now", "Limited Time", "Click Here"
- Use personalization: "Hi [Name], confirm your account"
- Be specific: "Confirm your Show Up or Else account"

#### Email Content Guidelines
- Maintain a good text-to-HTML ratio (at least 60% text)
- Include physical address in footer
- Use proper unsubscribe links
- Avoid excessive use of images
- Keep HTML clean and simple

### 5. **Technical Improvements**

#### Update Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:
```env
# Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://showuporelse.com
VERCEL_URL=https://showuporelse.com

# Email Addresses
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@showuporelse.com
ABUSE_EMAIL=abuse@showuporelse.com

- Open rate (industry average: 20-30%)
- Click rate (industry average: 2-5%)
- Bounce rate (should be <2%)
- Spam complaints (should be <0.1%)

### 6. **Gmail-Specific Optimizations**

#### Gmail Postmaster Tools

2. Add your domain: https://postmaster.google.com/
3. Monitor reputation and spam rates
4. Address any issues promptly
