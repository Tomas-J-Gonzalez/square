#Ideas

On landing the 'create your first event" button takes you to an engaging multistep event creation page?? instead of straight to sign-up (friction)

ical option on event invitations
available to view live event page (see event page) - only invitees can see

Make it so when i view detials of a past event i can only see the details and not the past events controls.

make invitation look less like a scam

Dont show active events on past events.

How will private events work? if a send an invite to someone what stops them from sharing?

Allow host to edit existing events?

Differentiate between on-the-fly events, not knowing where we goign yet, and already planned events.

Make it so if theres a collaborative group event creation they go 
through the below steps in a certain order. Split normal single
event creation with collaborative group creation.!!

"When are we all free"

"What are we doing?" (new card) 1st

"Where are we going"

Idea gen for events and colab to come up with ideas
Suggest ideas based on proximity of event location? and based on filters set.

"Games"
Decide who pays
Decide who

For current events, allow host and users to upload photos or messages.

Commited people who dont show up are flakes, not those who cant actually attend.

Does not being able to go == flaking, or is flaking just when someone says they'll go but dont show up?

fix ugly urls (e.g events page, best practice for nesting and urls naming conventions)
should dashboard always show as first sub url??? no

Shared photo/video albums post-event.

Birthday / anniversary auto-reminders tied to events.

#Escrow-style deposits (people pay a small refundable fee to secure attendance).
Streaks (friend streaks) - Streaks or progress trackers for attending events (gamify reliability).
Accountability groups where people set goals together (fitness, study, networking).

#Conflict-Free Scheduling
Auto-detect calendar conflicts and suggest alternative dates.
Sync across Google Calendar, Outlook, iCal, etc.
"Smart RSVP" where people vote availability and the app proposes the optimal time.

#AI Summaries & Follow-Ups (prem)
After an event, attendees get an automatic summary (meeting notes, key decisions, shared photos).
AI-generated “missed it?” digest for those who didn’t attend.

#Seamless Payments + Splitting
Group payments for things like dinners, Airbnb, or activities.
“Everyone pays their share upfront” — reduces the classic “I’ll pay you later” pain.

#Icebreaker prompts for networking events. or meeting new people
#Set of games for work stand ups etc

#Creative Communities (Linkup 2.0)
Collab boards for musicians, writers, designers to find jam sessions or co-working days.


🚀 Stickiness & Growth Features

Things that make your app not just useful, but habit-forming:

Reputation & Social Proof
Attendee reliability score (“Tomás has a 92% show-up rate”).
Event ratings/reviews (“This host is always well-organized”).

Community Layer
Groups/clubs with recurring events.
Membership perks (private chat, shared docs, pinned announcements).

Integrations
Slack/Discord bots for work or gaming groups.
Spotify for collaborative playlists before an event.
Notion/Miro for planning group projects.

Smart RSVP + Escrow Deposit
→ People RSVP and lock in with a tiny refundable payment. No-shows forfeit it.
Pain solved: flakes + accountability.

Auto-Scheduling Poll + Calendar Sync
→ Invitees pick times → app auto-chooses the best slot + books everyone’s calendars.
Pain solved: endless back-and-forth scheduling.

Event + Payment Splitter
→ Hosting a BBQ? Costs are split automatically across attendees, and payment is handled upfront.
Pain solved: awkward “who owes what” convos.

Hybrid Event + Auto-Recap
→ Host in-person but provide a lightweight virtual join option → app generates a summary (photos, notes, action items) for absentees.
Pain solved: FOMO and wasted info.

Attendee Reputation + Social Proof (friend streaks)
→ Reliability scores (e.g., “92% show-up rate”) + reviews of hosts/attendees.
Pain solved: weeding out chronic flakes or finding trustworthy people.

Recurring Groups + Shared Spaces
→ Clubs, teams, or recurring meetups get a persistent hub with chat, files, pinned notes, and schedules.
Pain solved: fragmentation across WhatsApp, email, and spreadsheets.

Smart Introductions + Icebreakers
→ Before an event, the app pairs people with shared interests and provides icebreaker prompts.
Pain solved: awkward networking / wasted connections.


Other 
Meeting Recap Bot for Slack/Discord (create briefs from Team calls)
→ Records, transcribes, summarizes meetings → outputs action items.
Target: Remote teams drowning in calls.

Portfolio Updater
→ Connects to Dribbble, Behance, LinkedIn → auto-pulls new work into a single page.
Target: Designers & devs who neglect their portfolios.


4. Micro-Pledge Communities 🤝

A tiny SaaS where groups commit to micro-pledges (like “we’ll all post one design a week” or “ship a feature every 10 days”) → failure triggers small penalty (money donated, social accountability).

Why unique? It’s like “Pomodoro meets group accountability” — but hyper-focused on output.

Target: Indie makers, student groups, creatives.


10. “Micro-Obituaries” for SaaS Tools 🪦

Track when SaaS tools shut down or change pricing → sends users backups + alternatives before it’s too late.
Why unique? Nobody likes waking up to “this product is shutting down in 30 days.”
Target: Indie hackers, SMBs, no-code users.
