On landing the 'create your first event" button takes you to an engaging multistep event creation page?? instead of straight to sign-up (friction)

ical option on event invitations
available to view live event page (see event page) - only invitees can see

Make it so when i view detials of a past event i can only see the details and not the past events controls.

make invitation look less like a scam

Dont show active events on past events.

How will private events work? if a send an invite to someone what stops them from sharing?

Allow host to edit existing events?

Differentiate between on-the-fly events, not knowing where we goign yet, and already planned events.


"When are we all free"

"What are we doing?" (new card)
Idea gen for events and colab to come up with ideas
Suggest ideas based on proximity of event location? and based on filters set.

"Games"
Decide who pays
Decide who

For current events, allow host and users to upload photos or messages.

Commited people who dont show up are flakes, not those who cant actually attend.

Does not being able to go == flaking, or is flaking just when someone says they'll go but dont show up?

fix ugly urls (e.g events page, best practice for nesting and urls naming conventions)
should dashboard always show as first sub url??? no
